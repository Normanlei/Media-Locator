# Project-01-Locator

## Description

As proceeing as a web developer, team project would be a mush-do thing in the real world. In our first project, our team "HTML" is building an application called "Media Locator",mainly using another application's API. This application can locate the place you are at or take in a specified location. After that, based on the name of a(n) artist/book/author/movie/comedian, lists recommendations related to the search and indicate if any of them have events near the location. Then the user can locate the place on the embedded Google map, get route to it and navigate separately. 

In this application, it mainly has two parts as below:
* Search/Start page along with input entering boxes

* Results display page along with a few functionalities

In the process of building this calendar, we have learned:
* Utilize Github repository, familiarize git commands to save all my works onto github
* Familiarize the basic html commands to build the full contents of the site, especially have better understanding on div.
* Familiarize the styling commands on css, especially have better understanding on float, padding, margin, position
* Familiarize the Materialize CSS framework
* Familiarize using jQuery to add more functional features along with html and css styling
* Familiarize using media query and slide-out side nav to make my site to be responsive

* Familiarilze using ajax to request data from the third party service side API
* Familiarilize using Google Map API as third party API with javascript implementation

## Demo

Motivation for development:
- The main motivation was to find similar things to something you like so you can expand your tastes. If you like one of the recommendations, you can go to an event thatâ€™s near you.

User story:
- As someone whose taste is getting stale, I want recommendations of something similar that I already like.
